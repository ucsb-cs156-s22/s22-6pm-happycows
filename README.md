# Description

This is a full rewrite of the application HappyCows, a project sponsored by [Mattanjah de Vries, Distingished Professor of Chemistry at UC Santa Barbara](https://www.chem.ucsb.edu/people/mattanjah-s-de-vries).


The application is a simulation game that gives players (typically students in Prof. de Vries' courses) an opportunity to learn about the [Tragedy of the Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons).

This rewrite uses the new tech stack being developed for [CMPSC 156](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io).    This tech stack uses:
* Spring Boot (Java) for the backend
* React (JavaScript) for the frontend
* Spring Security plus Google OAuth for authentication/authorization
  - This last point is what distinguishes this tech stack from the one currently in use (as S21) for the three legacy code apps in
    CMPSC 156: the current apps use Auth0 with JWTs as the authentication/authorization mechanism.

Storybook is here:
* Production: <https://happycows.github.io/HappierCows-docs/>
* QA: <https://happycows.github.io/HappierCows-docs-qa/>


The GitHub actions script to deploy the Storybook to QA requires some configuration; see [docs/github-actions.md](docs/github-actions.md) for details.

If these repos are not yet setup, see the setup steps in [`docs/storybook.md`](docs/storybook.md).

# Game Play for Developers

A description of how the game is played and what scheduled actions are run are given under [`docs/gamePlay.md`](docs/gamePlay.md)

# Setup before running application

Before running the application for the first time,
you need to do the steps documented in [`docs/oauth.md`](docs/oauth.md).

Otherwise, when you try to login for the first time, you
will likely see an error such as:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1119017/149858436-c9baa238-a4f7-4c52-b995-0ed8bee97487.png" alt="Authorization Error; Error 401: invalid_client; The OAuth client was not found." width="400"/>

# Getting Started on localhost

* Open *two separate terminal windows*  
* In the first window, start up the backend with:
  ```
  mvn spring-boot:run
  ```
* In the second window:
  ```
  cd frontend
  npm install  # only on first run or when dependencies change
  npm start
  ```

Then, the app should be available on <http://localhost:8080>

If it doesn't work at first, e.g. you have a blank page on  <http://localhost:8080>, give it a minute and a few page refreshes.  Sometimes it takes a moment for everything to settle in.

If you see the following on localhost, make sure that you also have the frontend code running in a separate window.

```
Failed to connect to the frontend server... On Heroku, be sure that PRODUCTION is defined.  On localhost, open a second terminal window, cd into frontend and type: npm install; npm start";
```

# Getting Started on Heroku

On Heroku, you'll need to set the following configuration variable:

* Using the Heroku CLI:
  ```
  heroku config:set PRODUCTION=true --app <heroku app name>
  ```
* Or set it on the Heroku Dashboard:
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1119017/149855768-7b56164a-98f7-4357-b877-da34b7bd9ea4.png)

You'll also need to follow the OAuth set up instructions here: [`docs/oauth.md`](docs/oauth.md).

If you get the following message on Heroku, it probably means that you failed to setup the `PRODUCTION` environment variable.

```
Failed to connect to the frontend server... On Heroku, be sure that PRODUCTION is defined.  On localhost, open a second terminal window, cd into frontend and type: npm install; npm start";
```

# Accessing swagger

To access the swagger API endpoints, use:

* <http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html>


# To run React Storybook

* cd into frontend
* use: npm run storybook
* This should put the storybook on http://localhost:6006
* Additional stories are added under frontend/src/stories

* For documentation on React Storybook, see: https://storybook.js.org/

# Accessing Database Console

* On localhost only: <http://localhost:8080/h2-console>  See also: [docs/h2-console.md](docs/h2-console.md)
* On Heroku, with CLI:
  - Use: `heroku psql --app app-name-here`
  - Note that this requires that you have the psql CLI tool installed on your system.  
  - This does work on CSIL, but you may need `heroku login -i` in order to login on CSIL
  - Example:

    ```
    [pconrad@csilvm-03 ~]$ heroku psql --app demo-spring-react-example
    â€º   Warning: heroku update available from 7.59.1 to 7.59.2.
    --> Connecting to postgresql-tapered-84555
    psql (13.4, server 13.5 (Ubuntu 13.5-2.pgdg20.04+1))
    SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off)
    Type "help" for help.

    demo-spring-react-example::DATABASE=>
    ```
* On Heroku, without CLI:
  - Upper right of dashboard, select "More" then "Run Console"

    <img alt="Heroku Dashboard; More; Run Console" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1119017/150204550-a1027ab8-6ce7-4770-b566-a43928f5c3a0.png" width="300" />
  - Enter `psql $DATABASE_URL` and click `Run`
